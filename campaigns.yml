# Configuration file for banner campaigns, for use in combination with https://github.com/wmde/banner-server
#
# Example
# B18WPDE_01_180131:
#   description: This is a very enticing banner description
#   start: "2018-01-31 00:00:00"
#   end: "2018-12-31 23:59:59"
#   trafficLimit: 10
#   buckets:
#   - name: B18WPDE_01_180131_ctrl
#     banners:
#     - B18WPDE_01_180131_fulltop_ctrl
#     - B18WPDE_01_180131_top_ctrl
#   - name: B18WPDE_01_180131_var
#     banners:
#     - B18WPDE_01_180131_fulltop_var
#     - B18WPDE_01_180131_top_var
#
# Start each campaign with a unique key, that is "campaign name". Usually these will be structured like in the example above:
# B18WPDE_01_180131
#   B18 -> The year of the banner campaign
#   WPDE -> wikipedia.de
#   _01_ -> Test number
#   180131 -> Start date of the test, YYMMDD format
# description: (optional) What this campaign is about
# start: Start date, in either YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
# end: End date, in either YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
# trafficLimit: Traffic limit in percent
# buckets: List of buckets which consist of two values:
#   name: The name used to identify the bucket.
#     Naming schema of buckets follows campaign name plus a unique bucket suffix. The usual practice is "_ctrl" for "control" and "_var" for "variant" test groups.
#   banners: An array of banner file names used for sequencing. First banner is shown only for the very first user impression. Last banner is shown until impression limit is reached
